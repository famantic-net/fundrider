# Synopsis

`python3 interactive_fund_plot.py [-t  <directory>]  -r <directory> | :internal:`

# Description

Creates interactive fund charts from csv tables generated by `slice_fund_files.pl`.

The charts all converge to value 0 (zero) at the end which is the latest date. The fund data has been normalized for all funds each with respect to the latest date so that it's either higher or lower than zero. This makes comparison between the existing funds very easy. The funds chart series that are placed lower on the chart have had a better increase with respect to the current fund value and oppositely if the fund chart series is graphed higher in the plot with respect to the latest value at the far right it shows the fund losing value.

# Options

- -r
  Specifies directory where to store the fund charts, unless the word '`:internal:`' is given. If `-r` is omitted the fund charts will be written to the current directory.
  If '`:internal:`' is given no individual fund charts will be written and the aggregated html containing all charts will be printed on STDOUT. See examples below.
- -t
  Specifies the directory where the csv fund tables that were generated by `slice_fond_files.pl` are located. The csv fund tables are expected to have names as '`fund_tables_<number>.csv'`. This is how the names will be created by the analysis part '`slice_fond_files.pl`'.
  If `-t` is omitted, input is expected on STDIN in the same format as the the csv fund tables. Only one csv table is expected when receiving from STDIN. If a directory is given with `-r` the result will be written to the file '`fund_series_chart.html`'. If `-r :internal:` is given the output will to STDOUT. See examples below.

# Examples

- Read all csv tables in directory '`../tables`' named ' `fund_tables_<number>.csv'` and create a fund chart for each table in directory '`../results`'. Charts will be named '`fund_series_chart_<number>.html`'.

  `python3 interactive_fund_plot.py -t ../tables -r ../results`

- Read all csv tables in directory '`../tables`' named ' `fund_tables_<number>.csv`' and print to STDOUT.

  `python3 interactive_fund_plot.py -t ../tables -r :internal:`

- Same as previous but rediect STDOUT to '`../results/fund_series_charts.stdout.html`'.

  `python3 interactive_fund_plot.py -t ../tables -r :internal: > ../results/fund_series_charts.stdout.html`

- Take input from STDIN and write from STDOUT to '`../results/fund_series_chart.stdout.html`'.

  `cat ../tables/fund_tables_5.csv | python3 interactive_fund_plot.py -r :internal: > ../results/fund_series_chart.stdout.html`

- Take input from STDIN and write from result chart to directory '`../results`' in file '`fund_series_chart.html`'.

  `cat ../tables/fund_tables_5.csv | python3 interactive_fund_plot.py -r ../results`
